# Covariate-Shift-and-Continual-Learning

## Summary
- During EDA found the problem of covariate shift in the NSL-KDD dataset. 
- Proposed a seven step process to detect and quantify the magnitude of shift in any dataset. 
- Formulated the problem as a continual learning task, and extended replay and regularization based continual learning techniques from computer vision and applied them to network security tasks. 
- Compared and analysed the performance of various continual learning algorithms.
